# Framework for Pytorch

## Introduction
This is a naive Pytorch training and testing framework for any deep learning project, which is aimed for new players to learn basic pytorch API or transfer for their own project.

The framework supports for CPU, single GPUs and multiple GPUs(only nvidia cuda). Some other tools are also contained for data preprocess.

## Install 

All package used in this framework (e.g. numpy, torch)


## Instructions

1. Train with  CPU/ single GPU:


```
python train.py
```

2. Train with multiple GPUs (bash):


```
bash train.sh
```
2. Train with multiple GPUs (zsh):
```
zsh train.sh
```
